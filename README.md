# 5 - Food-App-complete-React

In this application I used all core react features in action, including components, state, and much more, including work with Firebase.


<h3 align="center">About App:<h3>

 - In app you can see a list of meals from which we can choose. This list is in the Firebase.
- User can then add these meals to the cart and changed their amounts and add them multiple times.
- User can see what's in the cart.
- When you click on the order button, you will be able to fill out the delivery form with validation working.
