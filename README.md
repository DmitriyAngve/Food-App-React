# 5 - Food-App-complete

In this application I used all core react features in action, including components, state, and much more, including work with Firebase.


<h3 align="center">About App:<h3>

<div>- In app you can see a list of meals from which we can choose. This list is in the Firebase.</div>
<div>- User can then add these meals to the cart and changed their amounts and add them multiple times.</div>
<div>- User can see what's in the cart.</div>
<div>- When you click on the order button, you will be able to fill out the delivery form with validation working.</div>
